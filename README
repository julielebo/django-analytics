Scripts to gather data for Homework 3 of Software Metrics

For all below, download and untar a django release (or multiple releases) and install Radon.

where a Django released is installed into a directory on your computer like:
DJANGO=~/development/Django-1.7.6
Functional, i.e. non-test, source code is considered:
* $DJANGO/django
Test source code is considered:
* $DJANGO/tests


To get LLOC (separated into non-test and test code) for each considered Django release:
* cd into scripts/ directory
* execute:
    ./runRadon_getLLOC.sh ~/development/Django-1.7.6 ## of course, the path to your installation of Django may vary
* cd into results directory (script tells you where results went)
* for total LLOC metrics, use "tail -n *.out" to see summary data
